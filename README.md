### Pure React State Management
The state is managed by lifting the states within the components for the flow of data

### React Hooks State Management
The state is managed by creating the custom hook and passed on to the components

### Redux Thunk State Management
The state is managed by redux which maintains the store and thunk helps for asynchronous flows

### Redux Saga State Management
The state is managed by redux which maintains the store and saga helps asynchronous flowss

### RxJS State Management
The state is managed by RxJS which helps the state flows with observers and observables

### MobX State Management
The state is managed by MobX which helps the state flows with observers and observables
